# CrowNet - **Crow**d **Net**work

## Introduction

A central element of intelligent transport infrastructures as well as innovative mobility concepts is networking: intelligent vehicles and traffic control systems exchange information to make traffic safer, more efficient and more environmentally friendly. New forms of communication, e.g. via smartphones, enable new mobility concepts such as car and bike sharing. Here, road users communicate with each other as well as with mobility service providers and the transport infrastructure. The information thus distributed via mobile radio thus influences the behaviour of road users. At the same time, however, user behaviour and mobility also influence the communication infrastructure - up to a complete breakdown of communication, e.g. during major events or in extreme situations, such as the Munich attack in July 2016. With the increasing spread of intelligent transport systems, these interactions between transport infrastructure, user mobility and communication infrastructure will continue to increase. However, a particularly high density of active, communicating road users often arises from pedestrians travelling in groups - e.g. after a major event - or changing modes of transport.

Simulations can be used to investigate whether networking and information dissemination are robust in these mobility scenarios. In contrast to existing simulation systems, which simulate road traffic and mobile radio together, CrowNet focuses on the interaction of pedestrians and mobile radio networks. 

CrowNet (for crowd network) is an open-source simulation environment which
couples state-of-the art pedestrian locomotion models with wireless
communication models. It can be used to evaluate pedestrian communication
in urban and rural environments.

## Research project
CrowNet has been developed as part of the [roVer](https://www.hm.edu/allgemein/forschung_entwicklung/forschungsprojekte/projektdetails/wischhof/wischhof_koester_rover.de.html) research project at [Munich University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hm.edu/en/index.en.html).
roVer is a project funded by the [Federal Ministry of Education and Research](https://www.bmbf.de/) (Grant number: 13FH669IX6).

## Contributions

CrowNet has been developed by the research group of Lars Wischhof at the Department of Computer Science and Mathematics at the Munich University of Applied Sciences. We welcome contributions from anyone, who is interested in extending or improving the software framework.
